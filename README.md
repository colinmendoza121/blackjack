# blackjack
This is a simple blackjack game using the Python programming language in Pycharm.

## How to play
When the player first selects the game they will automatically be given a card as well as a menu.
This menu will then display a list of menu options ranging from 1 through 4, giving the user the option to input 1, 2, 3, or 4.
Inputting 1 will cause the player to recieve another card adding the value to their hand.
It displays the card they recieved and the player's hand. If 1 is inputted again the new card's value is added to their hand.
If the player's hand reaches 21 the player automatically wins. If the player goes over 21 they automatically lose.
Inputting 2 will cause the player to hold their hand and let the dealer deal out the dealer's hand.
If the dealer's hand is greater than the player's hand, the dealer wins. If they both have the same hand, it is a tie.
If the dealer's hand is less than the player's hand or the dealer's hand goes over 21, the player wins.
Inputting 3 will cause the statistics of the games played to be displayed.
The statistics include the number of player wins, dealer wins, tie games, games played, and the percentage of games won by the player.
Inputting 4 will cause blackjack to end. 
Any other input other than 1, 2, 3, or 4 will cause the player to be asked to only input the allowed inputs to the game.
